## My Journey
---
I began working as a software developer. It's been a fantastic learning opportunity that's been full with obstacles and potential for development. I've been working on a variety of projects over this period, honing my skills in a number of programming languages and frameworks.

Building a cutting-edge mobile app that transformed how people interact was one of the pinnacles of my professional career. The chance to collaborate with an excellent team and add to a product that will benefit millions of consumers was a fantastic opportunity.

## My Passions
---
I have a strong enthusiasm for reading in addition to my job life. My doorway into other places and viewpoints has always been through books. Science fiction, fantasy, and self-improvement books are a few of my favourites.

I also enjoy taking pictures of stunning situations when travelling. My perspectives are expanded, and my creativity is stimulated, by travelling to new locations and experiencing other cultures.
